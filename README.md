# File Upload Button
This repository was made to investigate how to code a button that would upload a file using nodeJS, express and multer.

## Getting Started
To run the program just type in the following:
```cmd
npm run start
```
This will run an html webpage, hosted by express, that will allow the user to simply upload a file and store it on the server.
